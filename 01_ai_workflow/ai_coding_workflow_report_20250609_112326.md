## 🎯 Generated Artifacts

### Function Overview
- **Function Name:** `calculate_factorial`
- **Generated Dependencies:** 4 packages
- **Usage Examples:** 4 provided
- **Test Coverage:** Comprehensive unit tests included

### Function Explanation
This improved implementation addresses all previous feedback and quality warnings:

1. Switched to iterative implementation to avoid stack overflow risks
2. Added upper bound validation (max 20) to prevent integer overflow
3. Implemented caching using @lru_cache for performance optimization
4. Added comprehensive logging for production monitoring
5. Included proper type hints throughout, including in test functions
6. Consolidated test cases using pytest.mark.parametrize
7. Added stress testing and benchmarking
8. Improved error handling with specific exception types
9. Added maximum value constraint parameter
10. Included proper logging configuration
11. Used proper dependency imports
12. Added comprehensive docstring documentation

The implementation now uses an iterative approach instead of recursion, which eliminates the stack overflow risk. The caching mechanism improves performance for repeated calculations. The code includes robust error handling, input validation, and comprehensive logging for production monitoring.

### Production Code
```python
def calculate_factorial(n: int, max_value: int = sys.maxsize) -> int:
    """
    Calculate the factorial of a given number using an iterative approach with caching.
    
    This implementation uses an iterative approach to avoid stack overflow issues with
    recursion and includes caching for performance optimization.
    
    Args:
        n (int): The number to calculate factorial for.
        max_value (int, optional): Maximum allowed value for computation. 
            Defaults to sys.maxsize.
    
    Returns:
        int: The factorial of the input number.
    
    Raises:
        TypeError: If the input is not an integer.
        ValueError: If the input is negative or too large.
    
    Examples:
        >>> calculate_factorial(5)
        120
        >>> calculate_factorial(0)

        for i in range(2, num + 1):
            result *= i
            if result > max_value:
                raise ValueError(f"Result would exceed maximum allowed value of {max_value}")
        return result
    
    try:
        logger.info(f"Calculating factorial for {n}")
        result = cached_factorial(n)
        logger.info(f"Factorial calculation completed: {n}! = {result}")

## 🤖 AI Expert Analysis


🤖 === AI-POWERED CODE ANALYSIS REPORT ===

Overall Quality Score: 8/10
Maintainability Score: 9/10

Security Assessment:
The code demonstrates good security practices with input validation and error handling. Key security aspects:
1. Input validation prevents negative numbers and non-integer inputs
2. Upper bound checking prevents integer overflow attacks
3. Exception handling with proper logging aids in security monitoring
4. Maximum value constraint parameter adds additional security control

Minor security concerns:
- Logging configuration in function body could be moved to module level
- Consider adding rate limiting for production use to prevent DoS attacks

Performance Analysis:
Performance characteristics:
- Time Complexity: O(n) for the factorial calculation
- Space Complexity: O(1) for each calculation, O(128) for cache storage

The implementation shows good performance optimization:
1. LRU cache with size 128 optimizes repeated calculations
2. Iterative approach prevents stack overflow
3. Early validation prevents unnecessary computation

Potential optimizations:
1. Consider using math.factorial for small numbers
2. Cache size could be tuned based on usage patterns
3. The logger initialization on every function call creates overhead

Test Coverage Assessment:
Test coverage is comprehensive with good quality:
1. Basic cases covered through parametrized tests
2. Edge cases and error conditions well tested
3. Performance stress testing included
4. Type checking in test functions

Areas for improvement:
1. Missing tests for cache hit scenarios
2. Could add property-based testing
3. No explicit coverage measurement
4. Missing integration tests for logging functionality

Code Smells Identified:
• Logger configuration inside function body instead of module level
• Nested function definition could be moved to module level
• Magic number '20' could be defined as a named constant
• Benchmark test could include more realistic scenarios

Positive Aspects:
• Comprehensive docstring with examples and type information
• Strong input validation and error handling
• Effective use of type hints throughout the code
• Well-structured test suite with parametrized tests
• Good use of caching for performance optimization
• Clear separation of concerns in implementation
• Proper exception handling with logging

Improvement Suggestions:
• Move logging configuration to module level initialization
• Extract cached_factorial as a module-level function
• Define MAX_FACTORIAL_INPUT = 20 as a module constant
• Add cache hit/miss testing scenarios
• Implement property-based testing using hypothesis
• Add explicit coverage measurement tools
• Consider using math.factorial for n <= 20
• Add rate limiting decorator for production deployment
• Improve benchmark tests with realistic scenarios
• Add integration tests for logging functionality

Detailed Expert Feedback:
The code demonstrates high-quality production-ready implementation with strong attention to best practices. Here's a detailed analysis:

Code Organization:
- The implementation is well-structured but could benefit from moving some elements to module level
- Function and test organization follows good separation of concerns
- Documentation is comprehensive and follows best practices

Production Readiness:
- The code is generally production-ready with robust error handling and logging
- Performance optimization through caching is well implemented
- Security considerations are properly addressed

Key Recommendations for Improvement:
1. Structural Changes:
   - Move logging configuration to module initialization
