## 🎯 Generated Artifacts

### Function Overview
- **Function Name:** `factorial`
- **Generated Dependencies:** 1 packages
- **Usage Examples:** 3 provided
- **Test Coverage:** Comprehensive unit tests included

### Function Explanation
The factorial function is implemented using recursion and includes several key features:

1. Type Hints: The function uses type hints to clearly specify that it takes an integer input and returns an integer output.

2. Comprehensive Error Handling:
   - Checks if input is an integer using isinstance()
   - Validates that input is non-negative
   - Raises appropriate exceptions with descriptive messages

3. Base Cases:
   - Handles n = 0 and n = 1, both returning 1
   - This prevents infinite recursion

4. Recursive Implementation:
   - For n > 1, multiply n by factorial(n-1)
   - This creates a chain of multiplication until reaching a base case

5. Documentation:
   - Detailed docstring following Google style
   - Includes description, arguments, return value, exceptions, and examples

The implementation is both efficient and readable, making it suitable for production use.

### Production Code
```python
def factorial(n: int) -> int:
    """
    Calculate the factorial of a given number using recursion.
    
    The factorial of a non-negative integer n is the product of all
    positive integers less than or equal to n. For example:
    5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120
    
    Args:
        n (int): The number to calculate factorial for.
            Must be a non-negative integer.
    
    Returns:
        int: The factorial of the input number.
    
    Raises:
        ValueError: If the input is negative.
        TypeError: If the input is not an integer.
    
    Examples:
        >>> factorial(5)
        120
        >>> factorial(0)
        1
    """
    # Input validation
    if not isinstance(n, int):
        raise TypeError("Input must be an integer")
    if n < 0:
        raise ValueError("Factorial is not defined for negative numbers")
    
    # Base cases
    if n == 0 or n == 1:
        return 1
    
    # Recursive case
    return n * factorial(n - 1)
```

### Dependencies
- `typing`

### Test Suite
```python
import pytest
from typing import Any

def test_factorial_basic_cases():
    """Test factorial function with basic positive integers."""
    assert factorial(0) == 1
    assert factorial(1) == 1
    assert factorial(5) == 120
    assert factorial(10) == 3628800

def test_factorial_negative_numbers():
    """Test factorial function with negative numbers."""
    with pytest.raises(ValueError) as exc_info:
        factorial(-1)
    assert str(exc_info.value) == "Factorial is not defined for negative numbers"
    
    with pytest.raises(ValueError) as exc_info:
        factorial(-100)
    assert str(exc_info.value) == "Factorial is not defined for negative numbers"

def test_factorial_invalid_types():
    """Test factorial function with invalid input types."""
    invalid_inputs: list[Any] = [1.5, "5", [5], None, True, {5}]
    for invalid_input in invalid_inputs:
        with pytest.raises(TypeError) as exc_info:
            factorial(invalid_input)
        assert str(exc_info.value) == "Input must be an integer"

def test_factorial_large_numbers():
    """Test factorial function with larger numbers to verify recursion works."""
    assert factorial(7) == 5040
    assert factorial(8) == 40320

def test_factorial_recursive_property():
    """Test that factorial follows the recursive property n! = n * (n-1)!"""
    n = 6
    assert factorial(n) == n * factorial(n-1)
```

### Usage Examples
1. `# Calculate factorial of 5
result = factorial(5)
print(f'Factorial of 5 is: {result}')  # Output: Factorial of 5 is: 120`
2. `# Handle zero case
result = factorial(0)
print(f'Factorial of 0 is: {result}')  # Output: Factorial of 0 is: 1`
3. `# Error handling example
try:
    result = factorial(-1)
except ValueError as e:
    print(f'Error: {e}')  # Output: Error: Factorial is not defined for negative numbers`
