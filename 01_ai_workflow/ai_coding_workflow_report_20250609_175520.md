## 🎯 Generated Artifacts

### Function Overview
- **Function Name:** `factorial`
- **Generated Dependencies:** 2 packages
- **Usage Examples:** 4 provided
- **Test Coverage:** Comprehensive unit tests included

### Function Explanation
The factorial function is implemented using recursion with the following key features:

1. Type Safety:
   - Uses type hints to specify input and output types
   - Includes runtime type checking for input validation

2. Error Handling:
   - Validates input type using isinstance()
   - Checks for negative numbers
   - Raises appropriate exceptions with descriptive messages

3. Implementation Details:
   - Uses recursion to calculate factorial
   - Handles base cases (0 and 1) explicitly
   - Follows mathematical definition: n! = n * (n-1)!

4. Documentation:
   - Comprehensive docstring with Google style
   - Includes description, arguments, returns, raises, and examples
   - Clear explanation of edge cases and expected behavior

5. Performance Considerations:
   - Simple and efficient implementation
   - Note: For very large numbers, this might hit Python's recursion limit
   - For production use with large numbers, consider using an iterative approach

The function follows all Python best practices and is production-ready with proper error handling and documentation.

### Production Code
```python
def factorial(n: int) -> int:
    """Calculate the factorial of a given number using recursion.

    This function calculates n! (n factorial) using a recursive approach.
    For example, 5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120

    Args:
        n (int): The number to calculate factorial for.
            Must be a non-negative integer.

    Returns:
        int: The factorial of the input number.
            For n = 0, returns 1 as 0! is defined as 1.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If the input is negative.
        TypeError: If the input is not an integer.

    Examples:
        >>> factorial(5)
        120
        >>> factorial(0)
        1
    """
    # Input validation
    if not isinstance(n, int):
        raise TypeError("Input must be an integer")
    if n < 0:
        raise ValueError("Factorial is not defined for negative numbers")
    
    # Base cases
    if n == 0 or n == 1:
        return 1
    
    # Recursive case
    return n * factorial(n - 1)
```

### Dependencies
- `typing`
- `pytest`

### Test Suite
```python
import pytest

def test_factorial_positive_numbers():
    """Test factorial calculation for positive numbers."""
    assert factorial(5) == 120
    assert factorial(3) == 6
    assert factorial(1) == 1

def test_factorial_zero():
    """Test factorial of zero."""
    assert factorial(0) == 1

def test_factorial_negative_numbers():
    """Test factorial with negative numbers raises ValueError."""
    with pytest.raises(ValueError) as exc_info:
        factorial(-1)
    assert str(exc_info.value) == "Factorial is not defined for negative numbers"

def test_factorial_non_integer():
    """Test factorial with non-integer inputs raises TypeError."""
    test_values = [3.14, "5", [1, 2, 3], None, True]
    for value in test_values:
        with pytest.raises(TypeError) as exc_info:
            factorial(value)
        assert str(exc_info.value) == "Input must be an integer"

def test_factorial_large_numbers():
    """Test factorial with larger numbers."""
    assert factorial(10) == 3628800

def test_factorial_known_sequences():
    """Test sequence of factorial calculations."""
    known_values = [
        (0, 1),
        (1, 1),
        (2, 2),
        (3, 6),
        (4, 24),
        (5, 120)
    ]
    for input_value, expected in known_values:
        assert factorial(input_value) == expected
```

### Usage Examples
1. `# Calculate factorial of 5
result = factorial(5)
print(f'Factorial of 5 is: {result}')  # Output: Factorial of 5 is: 120`
2. `# Handle zero case
result = factorial(0)
print(f'Factorial of 0 is: {result}')  # Output: Factorial of 0 is: 1`
3. `# Error handling example
try:
    result = factorial(-1)
except ValueError as e:
    print(f'Error: {e}')  # Output: Error: Factorial is not defined for negative numbers`
4. `# Calculate larger factorial
result = factorial(10)
print(f'Factorial of 10 is: {result}')  # Output: Factorial of 10 is: 3628800`
